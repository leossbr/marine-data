# Marine Data

The purpose of this app is to display the greatest distance travelled by each ship. More information about the data can be seen here: [here](https://www.marinetraffic.com/blog/information-transmitted-via-ais-signal/)
The `start` position of the ship is displayed in a green marker whereas the `end` position is displayed in red.
The app is accessible through this [link](https://leonardosiq91.shinyapps.io/marine-data/)
